Multi-Language Translation Script
by Patrick Hathway, OdinLab, University of Reading
Version 0.2.5 [2010-01-22]

This script automatically translates a webpage (containing text in more than one language) into any 
single language requested by the user. This can be particularly useful for sites involving a lot of 
user-generated content (which might have originally been written by a number of users who speak
different native languages) - e.g. blogs, forums, or other community sites. The script harnesses 
the Google AJAX Language API to perform translation and language detection.

From that website you will be able to view full documentation (including detailed usage instructions
and examples); as well as get the latest updates; request any changes or new features; report any 
bugs or problems; or make any other comments. All feedback is extremely welcome!


USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:


Below are some instructions describing very briefly how to deploy this script on your website:


1. Include the following 3 HTML lines somewhere on every webpage that uses the script:

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.google.com/jsapi"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="translate.js"></script>
<div id="mlt_languagelist"></div>

At this location of each page, a listbox will appear, allowing the user to change languages...

2. Open the file 'translate.js', and make the necessary configurations to the top of the script. 
The required changes are outlined within that file; and complete instructions/examples are shown 
in the full documentation [see the link above].

3. Upload the file 'translate.js' (as well as any changes made to any webpages in your site) to 
your server. Your work is complete!


The attached file 'example.htm' provides a very simple working example of the script in action.
Please ensure that you have extracted both 'example.htm' and 'translate.js' from the archive 
into a new folder before opening the example. View the source of 'example.htm' to see comments 
describing how the script interacts with the page. For further examples and much more detailed 
usage instructions, please check the full documentation.
